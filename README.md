# Weather-Dashboard
Build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

## Instructions

Build a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. Here are some guidelines:

* Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.

* Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* Your app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Display the following under current weather conditions:

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index

* Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity
